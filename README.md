# NukeAnalyticLMTs
A Pure Nuke implementation of an Analytic ACES LMT

Based on the CTL code and discussion on [AcesCentral](https://acescentral.com/t/lmts-part-4-how-do-they-work-and-how-are-they-made-continued/1217)

Currently my install of ctlrender is broken, so I can't compare to the CTL golden standard, but I believe this should match.

Currently intended for learning and experimental use.
